# Axis Discord Bot

Created for the Axis guild on the classic WoW server, Mirage Raceway, Horde.
Use at your own risk, the source is free for all.

## Commands

* `/ulduar` Creates a fresh event for Ulduar Val'anyr gamble and fills the outcomes with Ulduar boss names, which can drop
a fragment of Val'anyr.

* `/wallet` After player deposits some gold to the pot (guild bank or trade the organizer), records the deposited gold.
  Negative amount takes the gold from the wallet (refund).

* `/bid` Sends a bunch of bidding buttons to the player's private messages. Each button bids the bid amount (multiple
  bids allowed). Bid amount is set in the config .yaml file.

* `/bump` Reposts the event and deletes the old message, to keep it visible and fresh.
